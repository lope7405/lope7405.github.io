    <p>"Nothing's more influencuial than rap music"A line from Kendrick Lamar's "Black Friday" makes you think if the artist has a point. I believe he's correct but what rap artist do with that influence is what is important.</p>
    <p>A role model and an advocate for the people he represents, Lamar has used his platform to advocate for the people in his community. Lamar has donated millions to inner city school in california and has instilled several music programs around the country. </p>
    <p>The motivation to make others better than you were is what inspires me, leaving a better situation for future generations should be everyone's goal.</p>

                    <h3>Social Implications</h3>
                    <p> Climate change is an issue that has snuck up on the majority of us throughout the years. We have all heard the words global warming, but climate change is much more than that. This last winter we saw the freezing temperatures in Texas left thousands without power and killed 210 people. Climate change has always affected the weather, not only heating, and cooling the earth. The natural disasters that are caused by climate change have killed millions around the world, it is a social responsibility to those who have the power to help those who are affected. There shouldn’t be a debate when people have already lost their lives.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-sm">
                    <h3>Economic Implications</h3>
                    <p> How does climate change effect the economy? With every natural disaster comes a period of time where people are out of work, or out of their houses. I believe that the economic side of climate change is the most controversial, many debates stem from the fact that many companies benefit from activities that are not good for the planet. Fossil fuels are the main culprit of furthering the damage, but the oil and gas industry have been so interwoven inn our society that it will be next to impossible to replace it. We could slowly change over to alternative sources of energy but it will be met with a ton of pushback and will take a major economic plan to implement.

                <div class="col-sm">
                    <h3>Political Implications</h3>
                    <p class="pull-right">The political divide on this subject has always been the same, the right will always defend free enterprise before anything else, they may recognize the problem but will never give it the importance it deserves. The left is not much better though, they can give it the importance it deserves but cannot organize or agree on a way to fix it efficiently. </p>
                    <img class="img-responsive" src="/blog.png" width="500" />
                    <p class="pull-right">Regardless of which side of the political isle you land in, the subject of climate change has been brought up. It won’t be until both sides come to an agreement that we will see an actual positive change. </p>

                <div class="col-sm">
                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                    <p> Climate change will continue to be a hot issue for years to come, neither side will come to an agreement with the other and there will come a time where it may be too late. Climate change affects us every day, we don’t have to wait and see if something will happen because the things that we were being warned about are happening now. People are suffering every day, and the people with the power to help, are busy arguing the issue with no signs of stopping. For now all we can do is hope there is a plan that everyone can agree on in the works, until then we need to help whenever we can, and be open to changes.
